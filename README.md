### 🤖 An artificial intelligence that can play a simple 2D computer game using reinforcement learning

---

## 📝 Description

QMaster is a small reinforcement learning (RL) project where an AI agent learns to play a simple 2D game through **trial-and-error** 🧪.  
The project is intended as a clear, hands-on introduction to RL concepts: **state**, **action**, **reward**, and **learning algorithms** (such as Q-Learning or DQN) 🧠⚡.

This repository contains a minimal game environment (built with **pygame** 🎮) and an RL agent that interacts with the environment, collects rewards ⭐, and improves its policy over episodes 📈.
